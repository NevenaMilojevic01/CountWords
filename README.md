# Word Count Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA

A IntelliJ IDEA plugin that counts words, unique words, upper case words, lower case words, special characters, and numbers in the editor.

## Features

- Counts total words in the document.
- Optionally counts unique words.
- Counts all upper case and lower case words.
- Counts special characters and numbers.

## Getting Started


### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

```
### 2. Instructions to Run it
A new instance will open when it starts running. The example.txt file, used for testing the plugin, is located in the Kotlin folder of the project. You can use your own txt fail if you want.
When the txt file is opened, you must right-click, and at the end is a CountWords field. You then get a pop-up field that is used for counting words. Unique words are optional.
